# 🌸 Hi! I'm Mayela, a microbiologist exploring bioinformatics.

I work with **metagenomic and microbiome data** to study microbial diversity, functional pathways, and ecological interactions. I enjoy using tools like **phyloseq,** **kraken** and **KEGG Mapper** to turn sequencing data into biological insights.

I'm especially interested in the intersection of **microbiology, bioinformatics, and ecology** 🧬🌍.

I'm also part of **RSG Mexico**, where I help organize bioinformatics-related courses, symposia, and journal clubs.

Currently finishing my bachelor’s thesis and really excited about what comes next!
