# 🌸 Hi! I'm Mayela, a microbiologist exploring bioinformatics.

I work with **metagenomic and microbiome data** and exploring bioinformatics as a research approach applicable to biological questions in any context.

I’ve worked with tools like phyloseq, Kraken, and KEGG Mapper, and I enjoy learning new bioinformatics tools and computational

I'm also part of **RSG Mexico**, where I help organize bioinformatics-related courses, symposia, and journal clubs.

Currently finishing my bachelor’s thesis and really excited about what comes next!
