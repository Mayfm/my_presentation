# 🌸 Hi! I'm Mayela, a microbiologist exploring bioinformatics.

I work with **metagenomic and microbiome data**, and I enjoy applying bioinformatics to answer biological questions in any context.

I’ve worked with tools like **phyloseq**, **Kraken**, and **KEGG Mapper**, and I’m always excited to learn new computational methods.

I’m also part of **RSG Mexico**, where I help organize bioinformatics courses, symposia, and journal clubs.

Currently finishing my bachelor’s thesis and excited for what comes next!
